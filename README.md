# KATALOG

Katalog is an app intended for people and companies that have that feeling that their digital content is hard to keep track of: unstructured, duplicated, spread over filesystems, external drives, cloud storage and publishing tools. Over time, it's easy to lose control and oversight.

There are many apps in this space focusing on different aspects. This is our take on what Katalog should provide:

- Ability to catalogue (scan) user created digital assets, e.g. documents, photos, media or ultimately, any file.
- Can connect many content sources; local folders, network drivers, external drives, cloud storage, FTPs, CMS:es and support an easy plugin-architecture to connect more. These sources can be scanned once or repeatedly, depending on use case.
- Can analyze and process each asset with plugins, AI or commands, in order to build metadata or generated content.
- Provide an interface to search, browse and filter the assets
- Analyze the catalog in order to organize it; uncover forgotten content, de-duplicate, build version histories
- Provide various overviews, such as where assets tend to be, how well it's backed up, what projects dominate, etc.
- Ultimately, to also provide the ability to see where content has been published and make it easy to manage assets across all systems

What it is not:
- A new Spotlight. There are many great UIs for quickly finding and using files on an OS. These are better suited for quick access, and often also aim at finding all possible files and executables on a system.
- A backup or file management solution. There are great, robust tools for backup, syncing, copying and cloning. Katalog does not aim to recreate these - but it might provide shortcuts or interfaces to such tools.

Who is it for?
- Content creators who are losing overview of all their content, especially with cloud and remote storage becoming the norm
- Archivists and data hoarders who want to manage their archives across many types of media
- Small businesses needing a flexible Digital Asset Management solution
