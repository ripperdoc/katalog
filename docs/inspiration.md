# Inspiration and alternatives

When developing `katalog`, it faces the classic developer dilemma of re-inventing the wheel /
not-invented here. But it's also a strength of open source to be able to learn from, remix and
depend on what's already out there. We firmly believe that with the right APIs and abstractions, and
an open ecosystem, it's worth re-inventing at least a framework. However the goal of `katalog` is to
re-invent as little as possible, and instead rely on plugins built around the best open-source tools
already out there.
